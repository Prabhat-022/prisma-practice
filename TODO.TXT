Using this modern stack, we will build a basic user management API that will perform the following CRUD operations:

Create user accounts
Read user profiles
Update user information
Delete user accounts

Express will be used to build the web server, Prisma the ORM, MongoDB as the database, and Zod to validate payloads.
